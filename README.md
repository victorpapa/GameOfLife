# GameOfLife
This repository contains the source code for a Java application that simulates Conway's Game of Life. This application was created as a university project for the Object Oriented Programming Course.

The app can be run by running the .jar file (located in "out\artifacts\GameOfLife_jar"). 
It can also be run from the command line, by pressing "SHIFT + Right Click" inside the folder to open a terminal at the current folder and then running the .jar by typing "java -jar GameOfLife.jar".
